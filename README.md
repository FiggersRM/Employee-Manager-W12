# Employee-Manager-W12

## Description

In this week, we created a database for managing employees using mysql and made it possible for the user to update and get data from the database. The database contains three tables: departments, roles, and employees. Our task included being able to view all of the data in each database, and correctly joining the other tables' data when needed. For example, when viewing the roles table, we added the department name from the departments table to the results. With employees, we added their role, salary, department, and the manager from corresponding tables for each employee. In addition to viewing the data, the user also has the option to add a department, role, or employee, as well as update a current employee's role. The video below has a demonstration of how the application runs.

## Installation

Uses the inquirer, mysql, and console.table node packages

## Usage

This application can be used to manage a company's employees and departments. Departments can be added and job roles can be added to a department. In addition, companies can add employees and keep track of each employee's manager, pay, and which department they belong to.
